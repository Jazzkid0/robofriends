## RoboFriends

A simple user search site written in react. 
It pulls a user list from an example API, generates profile pictures from [Robohash](https://robohash.org) and shows them as cards.
You can then filter through the cards with the search bar.

You can run this project using the command `npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
